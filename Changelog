Changelog
--------
1.0b - 	More code cleanup (specifically the random number generation),
	debian support in the Makefile.  Ran the source through indent -kr
	which should make some people happy. More RH6 fixes.
1.0a -	Support for transparent terminals.  New mtx.pcf X window font that
	does not leave "streaks" down the collumns. Changed setenv() back
	to putenv() for portability. New matrix.psf.gz font for RH6.
1.0  -	Removed setfont from inside main loop, it slows things down too
	much. Changed usage output and man page to be more standard (?).
.99d -	Added update -C flag to determine color on command line.  Added
	the following runtime commands to change Matrix color: 
	! - red, @ - green, # - yellow, $ - blue, % - magenta, ^ - cyan, 
	& - white, ) - black.  Fixed misspellings of 'collumn' =)
.99c - 	VERSION updated properly *sigh*.  Makefile detects if root when 
	running "make install".  More variables added into Makefile to
	make configuring install easier.  Reinstated -x as -l check was
	broken and a workaround would be uglier than an extra flag.
.99b -	-x option removed, -l option now autodetects console or X (Bjoern).
	Added -n option to disable all color on command line (overrides -b
	and -B).  When not in screensaver (-s) mode, the following keys
	are available to change the program while executing: 
	n - disable bold, b - random bold, B - all bold, a - toggle
	asynch collumns, 0-9 - change update delay, q - quit.  "Matrix"
	font support improved.
.99a -	Experimental font support for the weird characters in the movie.
	New flags -l for Linux console and -x for X window terminal with
	mtx.pcf font loaded.
.99 -	Fixed typo in Changelog, updated VERSION for the first time since
	0.98a.  Took -u out of TODO, as it's done.  Tweaked Makefile. Oops =)
.98c -	The default mode now has random white (non-bold) leading
	characters in it, like the -o mode does.  Homepage now listed in
	README. Update flag (-u) added (Bjoern).
.98b -	Fixed a bug in the -h flag (not exiting)
.98a -	Scrolling is now more "movie" like and less Win/Mac screensaver like.
	Use -o mode for the original style.
.98 -	New option parsing code, many loop optimizations.  Looking for
	feedback on positive/negative performance gains, especially with -a
.97 -	CMatrix now forces the linux $TERM type by default, use -f to
	override this behavior.  Necessary because some xterms do not report
	color capability when in fact they have it.
.96 - 	Added -b option for some bold chars and -B for all bold, and removed
	some unnecessary code
.95 -	Cleaned up command line args (You can now do -as and -sa)
.91 - 	Added '-a' option for asynchronous scroll (MUCH more CPU overhead,
	but closer to the movie/original screensaver)
.90 -	lots more bug fixes - still need a good code cleanup =)
.20 -	lots of bug fixes
.15 -	Included command usage
.10 -	Included random 'heads' on random collumns
.05 -	Incorporated color and got those collumns scrolling
.03 -	Basic setup and define of screen
