04/03/2000 - CMatrix 1.1a is released.  After a hiatus, interest in the
		project has seemed to swell, so I'm releasing a 
		(hopefully) improved and updated version of CMatrix.
		As with nano, CMatrix has a page at SourceForge.net
		to further facilitate development, as well as two mailing
		lists, cmatrix-announce@lists.sourceforge.net and
		cmatrix-devellists.sourceforge.net.  Anyone is welcome
		to join and participate in the further development
		of CMatrix, particularly people have contributed up until
		now in it's development =-)
